# Solving Operations Research Problems with Pyomo
This repository contains programming exercises I practiced for an Udemy course where I learned the basic foundations of Pyomo (a Python-based optimization language) and how to model optimization problems by creating elements such as arrays, summations, inequalities, constraints, and objective functions. Different programming problems and their solutions can be found here. My course certificate is also attached
