# Solving Operations Research Problems with Pyomo
This repository contains programming exercises I practiced for the Udemy course "Optimization with Python - Solve Operations Research Problems".

In the course, I learned the basic foundations of Pyomo (a Python-based optimization language) and how to model optimization problems by creating elements such as arrays, summations, inequalities, constraints, and objective functions. 

Different programming problems and their solutions can be found here, along with my course certificate.
